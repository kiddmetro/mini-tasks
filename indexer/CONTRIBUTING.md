## Contributing to Optimistic Indexer

Thanks for your interest in improving Optimistic Indexer!

There are multiple opportunities to contribute at any level. It doesn't matter if you are just getting started with Typescrit or are the most weathered expert, we can use your help.

**No contribution is too small and all contributions are valued.**

This document will help you get started. **Do not let the document intimidate you**.
It should be considered as a guide to help you navigate the process.

The [Polynomial Discord](https://discord.com/invite/polynomial) is available for any concerns you may have that are not covered in this guide.

If you contribute to this project, your contributions will be made to the project under the MIT license.

### Code of Conduct

The Optimistic Indexer project adheres to the [Typescript Code of Conduct](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). This code of conduct describes the _minimum_ behavior expected from all contributors.

Instances of violations of the Code of Conduct can be reported by contacting the team at [Polynomial Protocol](https://twitter.com/PolynomialFi).

### Ways to contribute

There are fundamentally three ways an individual can contribute:

1. **By opening an issue:** For example, if you believe that you have uncovered a bug
   in Optimistic Indexer or see a way to improve it further, creating a new issue in the issue tracker is the way to get started.
2. **By adding context:** Providing additional context to existing issues,
   such as screenshots and code snippets to help resolve issues.
3. **By resolving issues:** Typically this is done in the form of either
   demonstrating that the issue reported is not a problem after all, or more often,
   by opening a pull request that fixes the underlying problem, in a concrete and
   reviewable manner.

**Anybody can participate in any stage of contribution**. We urge you to participate in the discussion around bugs and participate in reviewing PRs.

### Asking for help

If you have reviewed existing documentation and still have questions, or you are having problems, you can get help by **opening a discussion**. This repository comes with a discussions board where you can also ask for help. Click the "Discussions" tab at the top.

### Submitting a bug report

When filing a new bug report in the issue tracker, you will be presented with a basic form to fill out.

If you believe that you have uncovered a bug, please fill out the form to the best of your ability. Do not worry if you cannot answer every detail, just fill in what you can. Contributors will ask follow-up questions if something is unclear.

In order to rule out the possibility of the bug being in your project, the code snippets should be as minimal as possible. It is better if you can reproduce the bug with a small snippet as opposed to an entire project!

See [this guide][mcve] on how to create a minimal, complete, and verifiable example.

### Submitting a feature request

When adding a feature request in the issue tracker, you will be presented with a basic form to fill out.

Please include as detailed of an explanation as possible of the feature you would like, adding additional context if necessary.

If you have examples of other tools that have the feature you are requesting, please include them as well.

### Resolving an issue

Pull requests are the way concrete changes are made to the code, documentation, and dependencies of Optimistic Indexer.

Even tiny pull requests, like fixing wording, are greatly appreciated. Before making a large change, it is usually a good idea to first open an issue describing the change to solicit feedback and guidance. This will increase the likelihood of the PR getting merged.

#### Commits

It is a recommended best practice to keep your changes as logically grouped as possible within individual commits. There is no limit to the number of commits any single pull request may have, and many contributors find it easier to review changes that are split across multiple commits.

That said, if you have a number of commits that are "checkpoints" and don't represent a single logical change, please squash those together.

#### Opening the pull request

From within GitHub, opening a new pull request will present you with a template that should be filled out. Please try your best at filling out the details, but feel free to skip parts if you're not sure what to put.

#### Reviewing pull requests

**Any Optimistic Indexer community member is welcome to review any pull request**.

All contributors who choose to review and provide feedback on pull requests have a responsibility to both the project and individual making the contribution. Reviews and feedback must be helpful, insightful, and geared towards improving the contribution as opposed to simply blocking it. If there are reasons why you feel the PR should not be merged, explain what those are. Do not expect to be able to block a PR from advancing simply because you say "no" without giving an explanation. Be open to having your mind changed. Be open to working _with_ the contributor to make the pull request better.

Reviews that are dismissive or disrespectful of the contributor or any other reviewers are strictly counter to the Code of Conduct.

When reviewing a pull request, the primary goals are for the codebase to improve and for the person submitting the request to succeed. **Even if a pull request is not merged, the submitter should come away from the experience feeling like their effort was not unappreciated**. Every PR from a new contributor is an opportunity to grow the community.

##### Be aware of the person behind the code

Be aware that _how_ you communicate requests and reviews in your feedback can have a significant impact on the success of the pull request. Yes, we may merge a particular change that makes Optimistic Indexer better, but the individual might just not want to have anything to do with Optimistic Indexer ever again. The goal is not just having good code.

##### Abandoned or stale pull requests

If a pull request appears to be abandoned or stalled, it is polite to first check with the contributor to see if they intend to continue the work before checking if they would mind if you took it over (especially if it just has nits left). When doing so, it is courteous to give the original contributor credit for the work they started, either by preserving their name and e-mail address in the commit log, or by using the `Author: ` or `Co-authored-by: ` metadata tag in the commits.
